A project to build a remote patient monitoring system which uses short 
range bluetooth low energy medical devices, verifies proximity to a 
trusted device, and sends the data to medical professionals who verify the 
data is from a trusted device, saving it to a distributed ledger running a 
proof of authority consensus protocol.

The idea is to design the system to be resistant to attacks where fake 
medical measurements are being sent to the medical profesionals.

The proof of authority blockchain is meant to ensure the validators have 
correctly assessed any measurements before adding them to the ledger.

The use of a distributed ledger (on a consortium blockchain) is done 
ensure the records cannot be edited by any one party.

The research behind this project is in the academic paper attached.

My MSc courses FOUNDATIONS OF HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS (COMP7070) and 
BLOCKCHAIN AND DIGITAL FUTURES (COMP7058) form the knowledge base for this 
project.

This project is still a work in progress and is not for use in a 
production environment (just a reminder).
